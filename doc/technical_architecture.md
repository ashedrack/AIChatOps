# Technical Architecture

## Application Architecture

### FastAPI Application
```
[FastAPI App]
    ├── OpenAI Integration
    ├── API Endpoints
    ├── Request/Response Models
    └── Error Handling
```

### Container Architecture
```
[Docker Container]
    ├── Python Runtime
    ├── FastAPI Application
    ├── Dependencies
    └── OpenAI SDK
```

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Cloud Resources (AWS)
- Managed through Terraform IaC
- Infrastructure defined in `infra/main.tf`
- Environment-specific configurations

### Kubernetes Architecture
```
[Ingress] → [Service] → [Deployment/Pods]
                          ↑
                     [Auto-scaling]
```

- **Deployment**: Manages chatbot API pods
- **Service**: Load balancing and service discovery
- **Ingress**: External access configuration
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on load metrics

## CI/CD Architecture

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
```
[Git Push] → [Build] → [Test] → [Deploy]
             ↓         ↓        ↓
        [Docker]  [Testing]  [K8s]
```

- Automated builds on push to main
- Container image creation
- Automated testing
- Kubernetes deployment

## Monitoring Architecture

### Components
```
[Application Metrics] → [Prometheus] → [Grafana]
[Application Logs]   → [ELK Stack]
```

### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Elasticsearch for log storage
- Logstash for log processing
- Kibana for log visualization

### Load Testing
- K6 for performance testing
- Metrics collection

## Security Architecture

### Application Security
- API authentication
- OpenAI key management
- Request validation
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Kubernetes RBAC
- Network policies
- Secure service configurations
- AWS IAM integration
